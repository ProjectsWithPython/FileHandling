### Package for File Handling

**Getting started**
```py
from EasyFileHandling.main import FileHandler

x = FileHandler('test.py', 'py')

print(x.get_file_content()) # This will print file content.

```
**Whats so special about package**


*This lets you use `os` module easily not all features but some of them.


**Whats New?**


*Version: `1.3.0`: In version `1.3.0` we have added a new method for `FileHandler` class called `is_file_writeable` simply it returns a boolean and tells if file is readable or not. If you are having any issues let us know [Here](https://github.com/ProjectsWithPython/FileHandling/issues).*
